      <p>Our biggest concern is the level at which the country is lacking skill in maths and science. It is therefore,
        our main purpose to ensure that we raise a large number of students with Maths and science. The school will be
        focusing on 80% Maths & Science to ensure that we prepare our students to participate in Renewable Energy,
        Engineering studies, Technology and medical science.</p>
